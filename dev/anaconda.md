Installation Anaconda
-------------------------------

Note that these steps are for Anaconda. If you do not use Anaconda, see dev/pip.md .

After installing Anaconda, make sure your scikit is the latest version by typing: 

    conda install -f scikit-learn 
    
Instructions for Lasagne are only available for pip so far, so you can't run neural network code.
