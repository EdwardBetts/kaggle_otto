Git commands
-------------------------------

If you're not using the GUI, you can use these commands:

* git clone [path] - download a git directory you don't have yet
* git pull -u origin [branch] - get the changes from other people for branch
* git branch - see all the branches (current one has a *)
* git checkout [branch] - go to another branch (commit your changes first)
* git status - shows which files have been added and committed
* git commit -m "[message]" - save all the added file as commit (which is like a chapter)
* git push -u origin [branch] - send your commits (the opposite of push)
* git merge [branch] - add everything from the named branch to the current branch
